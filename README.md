# PyDocker
Toy Docker implementation built in Python.

ðŸ‘€ I know this README is awfully scant. Don't worry, I'll be adding more to the README soon.

What can PyDocker do?
Pulls an image from Docker Hub and execute commands in it.

Pydocker Usage:
```bash
python pydocker.py pull <image_name>
python pydocker.py run <image_name> <command>
```
